                <p> <b> Hello, I'm Sarah! A cartographer, biologist, computer-savvy cat mom who wants to save the environment with GIS.</b> My first glimpse into the world of environmental health was through my undergraduate research at University of Wisconsin - La Crosse. I evaluated the developmental toxicity of Triclosan on Zebrafish. I had the opportunity to present this work at the National Conference for Undergraduate Research (NCUR) and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) regional and national conferences. As well as be a co-author on this study published in the journal, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27045765" target="_blank">Zebrafish.</a> </p>

                <p> During my time at UW - La Crosse I was exposed to GIS for the first time. I instantly found it intriguing and an amazing way to visually explain phenomena, leading me to minor in it. Shortly after graduation I was living in Austin, TX and hired as a GIS analyst at the University of Texas School of Public Health. I used GIS as part of a large project to analyze tobacco use in students around the state. During that time I was also working for a non-profit by canvassing to keep the Clean Water Act intact as well as other local environmental causes. </p>
                <p> After some time off from GIS I knew I wanted to get back into the field. This led me to the online Master's Program at University of Wisconsin - Madison. Since starting the program I have worked as a GIS technician intern for an Internet service provider and a student worker at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) in the petroleum remediation group. <b> In the future I hope to use my GIS skills in the field of environmental protection or renewable energy.</b> </p>

                <p> Besides my professional goals I always make a point to continue learning on a personal level. My number one advice to anyone is to get out of your comfort zone at least once a year. One of my favorite ways to learn and challenge myself is by travel. I've been able to explore several parts of the world and am always looking for another adventure. A couple of my most memorable trips were visting Cuba and Munich during Oktoberfest. </p>
